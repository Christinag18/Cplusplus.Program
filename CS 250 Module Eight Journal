How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Analyzing the system is usually the first step in comprehending user wants.  This can be accomplished by asking the team for input and talking to previous users about any errors or changes they think the code needs.  Additionally, inputs and outputs should be identified. 
User stories enable consumers to express their needs and wants, thus assisting in gathering this information. Analyzing the user stories will help us understand the perspective of the final customers. 

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
There are several different methods to approach program development. One strategy is the Waterfall Approach. Waterfall makes it simpler to forecast the needs of a specific strategy. 
Agile represents another method. Agile seems to offer a more flexible strategy and represents a more unique way of engaging with client integration, planning, and testing. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
In my view, a valuable team member is someone who comprehends their responsibilities within the project, stays on top of their input, and prevents delays that could hinder the progress of other team members. Furthermore, I think that paying attention to your colleagues and offering support to those who require assistance are essential elements of being an effective team member.
